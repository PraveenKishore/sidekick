A Fun Digital Assistant

## Features

* Fun chat with SideKick offline
* Find some hidden easter eggs ;)

## Speaking Notifications
Let sidekick read the notifications for you. Reads the messages for you. 
Remember the times when you were listening to your favourite music on your way home and receive a message. Sick of pulling your phone and unlocking it just to read it? With SideKick, you could continue to enjoy your music as side kick reads the message/notification for you. You can disable it if you want.

## SideKick Assistant
Bored? check out our fun chatting assistant and have a fun conversation! Power of AIML on android. The intelligence of the app can be updated on the go, without updating the app itself. All the intelligence is stored on a seperate file which can be updated without any modifications in the code. And dont worry about privacy, the app doesnt upload your data anywhere and is fully offile app. (**Bits for Nerds: TreeSet is used to store and access the intelligence in memory**)

## Easter eggs
Ask and interesting things and be surprised with the response ;)

**NOTE:** The AIML has to be updated for the app to be completely be functional chat assistant. Await for the next update.
